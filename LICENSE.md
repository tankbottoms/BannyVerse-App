## Terms of Use 

Effective Date: January 3, 2022

Welcome to Movement DAO! 

Please read these Terms of Use (the “Agreement” or “Terms”) carefully, along with any other policies or notices and our Privacy Policy (defined below) located at https://move.xyz, as they lay out the rules, terms, and guidelines for you to follow when using and accessing our website or participating in the DAO.  This Agreement governs your use of Movement DAO and constitutes a legally binding agreement between each user (“you,” “your,” or “User”) and Movement DAO (“we,” “us,” or “our”).

We may revise these Terms at any time without notice to you. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at https://move.xyz. 

In order to be a contributor to Movement DAO or purchase tokens on the DAO, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (“Account”). You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18) to obtain an Account, unless a specific Service permits otherwise.

### Overview

This section is a brief summary of the highlights of the terms of use of the DAO’s website or services.  We know that many terms of services can be long and full of confusing language so we have done our best to summarize the Terms in language that you will understand.  When you accept this Agreement, you are accepting all of our Terms and not just this section. Simply by browsing the Site, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully. 

Movement DAO is an experimental, novel approach to nonprofits devoted to performing good works and encouraging social justice in today’s contemporary society.  The DAO is a blockchain-based organization that raises funds through the purchase of tokens that entitles the purchaser, or member, to champion specific nonprofit works or projects and seek additional funding from like-minded individuals.  Movement DAO hosts blockchain software as a backend service for customers who set up their own accounts and purchase tokens.

Movement DAO is neither designed to be, nor is it set up to be, an investment vehicle and no jurisdiction has deemed any token produced by Movement DAO to be a “security” as defined by the 1933 Securities and Exchange Act (“The Act”).  Movement DAO is specifically designed to take advantage of the benefits of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to ensure that contributions to nonprofit works will have a larger impact based upon larger financial backing than traditional nonprofit corporations or charities.  

### How You Accept These Terms

By accessing our site or setting up an account in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms, as well as the accompanying privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), which is accessible at https://move.xyz.

Note that we reserve the right to modify the Terms at any time in our sole discretion. Any changes to the Terms will be posted on our website at https://move.xyz and will become effective immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to check for updates to these Terms periodically.

### Eligibility

You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than eighteen (18) years of age), to contribute to Movement DAO or purchase tokens. In addition the purchase of tokens at this point is limited to those who qualify as “accredited” investors under the Act.  

You can only participate in and enjoy the benefits of membership to the extent the laws of your jurisdiction or the laws of the United States do not bar you from doing so. Please make sure these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you.

By contributing to Movement DAO or becoming a member of our community, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements we outline in these Terms. We always reserve the right to exercise our discretion as we see fit to refuse to allow certain individuals to contribute or become members of the DAO and further we may also change our eligibility criteria at any time.

### Your Account With Movement DAO

In order to become a member of our community, you will need to create an Account to be able to purchase tokens as outlined above.  In order to create an Account, you will need to provide us with your your full name, organization, email address, phone number, billing address and account login information. In addition, we may collect information regarding other accounts you choose to link with Movement DAO (e.g., Metamask, Google, etc.).

By creating an Account, here are a few common sense rules and acknowledgements that we ask you comply with and understand:

Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. It is not copacetic to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your Account. Any failure to provide complete and accurate information can lead to the immediate termination of your Account -- and we do not want to do that!

*You are responsible for your Account.* You are solely responsible for any activity on your Account or any actions undertaken by your membership in a community. If you are sharing an Account with other people (e.g., if you are representing a business entity or trust), then you will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business and must notify us that you are purchasing the tokens on behalf of a business which membership shall be managed by you. Your Account is not transferable. You are solely responsible for any activity on your Account, so it is important to keep your Account password secure. In case of a dispute over the identity of the user, the authorized account holder of the Movement DAO or purchaser of the tokens will be deemed to be the user. “Authorized account holder” of an account is defined as the natural person assigned to the email address associated with the Account.

*Be clear about our relationship.* Creating an account and purchasing tokens from Movement DAO does not create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship with the DAO. No confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created with the DAO other than pursuant to these Terms.  You will become a member of the community and enjoy all of the rights and benefits of membership as outlined above.  

*Passwords.* You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access Movement DAO or any wallet designed to hold any tokens purchased through the DAO.  We encourage you to use “strong” passwords with your Account. 

*Emails.* By creating an Account, you agree that you may receive communications from Movement DAO, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates. You will also receive emails or communications designed to update you on any project or movement that you have indicated interests you and in which you wish to participate.  

*Impersonation.* If someone has created an account in which he or she pretends to be you, and you send us a request to take down that account, please be sure that you have included the email address of the fake account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of your password or Account or any other breach of security; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session when using Movement DAO.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section of the Terms.

### Warranty & Limitation of Liability (or The Things You Cannot Sue Us For)
#### Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, SERVANTS, COUNSEL, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, LAWYERS, AND OTHER PERSONNEL AUTHORIZED TO ACT, ACTING, OR PURPORTING TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF (COLLECTIVELY THE “MOVEMENT DAO”) BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR: (A) ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS INSTITUTED) OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR MEMBERSHIP IN MOVEMENT DAO; (II) ANY MONETARY LOSS YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THE PURCHASE OF ANY TOKENS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVEMENT DOA; (III) ANY LOSS YOU ASSOCIATE WITH A PROJECT OR MOVEMENT IN WHICH YOU PARTICIPATE OR CONTRIBUTE THE BACKING OF YOUR TOKENS.  

THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER BASED ON TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

#### Warranty Disclaimer

MOVEMENT DAO MAKES NO WARRANTY OF SUCCESS OF ANY PROJECT OR MOVEMENT NOR DOES IT MAKE REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING THE WORTH OR VALUE OF ANY TOKEN PURCHASED IN SUPPORT OF A PROJECT OR MOVEMENT.  THE MEMBER AGREES THAT HE OR SHE ACCEPTS ALL RISK OF LOSS FOR ANY TOKEN PURCHASED THROUGH MOVEMENT DAO AND THAT NO REPRESENTATION REGARDING THE FUTURE VALUE OF ANY TOKEN HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO ANY MEMBER OF THE DAO.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

#### Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Movement DAO from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees) arising from: (i) any action taken by you while a member that causes harm; (ii) any User Content you post, program, upload, use, distribute, store, or otherwise transmit through the Site or in conjunction with any project or movement associated with Movement DAO; (iii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; or, (iv) your violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or the rights of any third party.

#### Time Limitation on Claims

You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with us must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose where, for purposes of this section, the time that the injury or harm occurred – not when it was discovered thereafter – is where it arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.

#### Governing Law

No matter where you are located, the laws of the State of Florida will govern these Terms and the parties’ relationship as if you signed these Terms in Florida, without regard to Florida state’s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of these Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded or modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the federal or state courts in Miami Dade County, Florida, for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Services or your breach of these Terms.  You waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non conveniens in any such action.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

#### Note to International Users

Movement DAO is based in the United States, but will have international reach. If you are a user accessing the Site from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by United States law, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.

#### Termination

We reserve the right to terminate your membership for misconduct or conduct detrimental to the community upon vote by the community.  Termination of membership removes the right to vote on any action of any movement, suggest movements, make recommendations or suggestions to any movement, but it does not deprive the member of his or her tokens.  That member shall still be allowed to sell the tokens, at his or her discretion, on the bonding curve, as outlined above.

#### No Waiver

Our failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof.

#### Severability

If it turns out that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void, or, for any reason, unenforceable, such term or provision will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of this term or provision will not affect any other terms of this Agreement.

#### Mandatory Arbitration & Waiver of Right to Class Action

The parties agree to mandatory arbitration to resolve any dispute arising from this Agreement or your membership or association with Movement DAO. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. The parties agree that: (i) any arbitration will occur in Miami, Florida; and, (ii) the arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of American Arbitration Association for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, in the English language, and with limited discovery. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or virtually or telephonically and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available to a court or other tribunal. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. THE ARBITRATION DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND MOVEMENT DAO WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR COMMENCE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR OTHER SIMILAR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDINGS.  YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY BECOMING A MEMBER OF MOVEMENT DAO YOU VOLUNTARILY GIVE UP THESE RIGHTS.

#### Force Majeure

We shall not be held liable for any delays, failure in performance, or interruptions of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorism, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe, or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  This would include any delay in providing funding to a movement or other delay associated with a project of Movement DAO due to an act described above.

#### Entire Agreement

This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement as to the subject matter hereof including membership in Movement DAO or the purchase of any tokens associated with Movement DAO and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of this Agreement) and every nature between us. Except as provided for above, any modification to this Agreement must be in writing and must be signed by both parties.
